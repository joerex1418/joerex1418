I'm a sucker for projects where I get to automate workflows in every-day tasks (generating spreadsheets, fetching relevant data through HTTP requests). I'm also fascinated by the concept of UI designs and aesthetics. Nothing I love more than finding an awesome API and making a new web app out of it. I usually have leaned on Python and the Flask framework for these kinds of projects. 

Right now, I'm most involved with developing a couple of personal projects - Python packages, in particular.
