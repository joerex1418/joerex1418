### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**joerex1418/joerex1418** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Programming language experience includes Python (my first!), JavaScript, a little bit of Java, and most recently Swift.

I'm fascinated by the concept of UI designs and aesthetics. Nothing I love more than finding an awesome API and making a new app out of it. I'm also a sucker for projects where I get to automate workflows in every-day tasks (generating spreadsheets, fetching relevant data through HTTP requests)

Most of my current projects have involved learning Swift and developing personal iOS apps with SwiftUI

- âš¡ Fun fact: First started learning Python my senior year of high school. Went on a 5-year hiatus for some reason, but now I'm more active than ever!
