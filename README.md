### Greetings! I'm Joe!

My programming language experience includes Python (my first!), JavaScript, and most recently Swift. I also dabble in HTML & CSS.
At some point, I'd love to learn Rust, Go, and maybe C++

I'm also a sucker for projects where I get to automate workflows in every-day tasks (generating spreadsheets, fetching relevant data through HTTP requests). I'm also fascinated by the concept of UI designs and aesthetics. Nothing I love more than finding an awesome API and making a new web app out of it. I usually have leaned on Python and the Flask framework for these kinds of projects.

Right now, I'm most involved with learning Swift and developing some iOS apps with SwiftUI

- âš¡ Fun fact: First started learning Python my senior year of high school. Went on a 5-year hiatus for some reason, but now I'm more active than ever!
